This project is a trip registration application to replace the Pen & Paper data entry systems that were used by R.E.D. Hospitality and Leisure LLC. 
The application both reads and writes to a connected Apache SQL server that manages the trip and guest information. It also has the capability to format 
selected trip data into acceptable documents to be sent via a connected email client to financial and accounting personnel. Designed for R.E.D. employees,
it features a user friendly UI to make data entry and retreival simple and time efficient.
